Really lethargic.  No exercise.  I had only a bit of rice for lunch,
and three eggs with salami and two fiber tortillas for dinner.  And a small
dark chocolate bar.

I ate well but unenthusiastically.  Calories were kept below 1200, and I ate a massive amount of
fiber, but not enough protien.  I had one cocktail before dinner.

I did a half-hearted but high heart rate cardio session on an elliptical for 20 minutes.
